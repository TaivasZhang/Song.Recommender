# Welcome to Song Recommender

In this repository sat a project that exploited the Million Song Dataset to build a Song Recommendation Engine. Other than other recommendation systems that either used content based or collaborative filtering techinques, this Recommender focuses on the intrinsic features embedded in the beats, rhythms, and vocals of a song. Such features can be extracted using the mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

The repository contains the following files:

* hdf5_gatters.py
* hdf5_json_all.py
* EDA.jpynb
* Recommender.jpynb
* Results GUI.jpynb
* Million Song slides.pdf
